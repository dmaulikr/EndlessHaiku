Ringai#In these dark waters#Drawn up from my frozen well...#Glittering of spring
Buson#Standing still at dusk#Listen... In far distances#The song of froglings!
Kikaku#I dreamed of battles#And was slain... Oh savage samurai!#Insatiable fleas!
Bon Cho#In silent mid-night#Our old scarecrow topples down...#Weird hollow echo
Raizan#Women planting rice...#Ugly every bit about them...#But their ancient song
Soin#Wild geese write a line#Flap-flapping across the sky...#Comical dutch script
Shushiri#Dead my old fine hopes#and dry my dreaming but still...#Iris, blue each spring
Issa#In this windy nest#Open your hungry mouth in vain...#Issa, stepchild bird
Basho#Ballet in the air...#Twin butterflies until, twice white#They meet, they mate
Issa#Dew evaporates#And all our world is dew... So dear,#So fresh, so fleeting
Basho#Black cloudbank broken#Scatters in the night... Now see#Moon-lighted mountains!
Basho#Seek on high bare trails#Sky-reflecting violets...#Mountain-top jewels
Basho#For a lovely bowl#Let us arrange these flowers...#Since there is no rice
Basho#Now that eyes of hawks#In dusky night are darkened...#Chirping of the quails
Buson#My two plum trees are#So gracious... See, they flower# One now, one later
Moritake#One fallen flower#Returning to the branch?... Oh no!#A white butterfly
Ryota#Cloudbank curling low?#Ah! The mountain Yoshino...#Cherry cumulus!
Ryota#Fie! This fickle world!#Three days, neglected cherry-branch...#And you are bare
Shiki#Hanging the lantern#On that full white blooming bough...#Exquisite your care!
Basho#April's air stirs in#Willow-leaves... A butterfly#Floats and balances
Basho#In the sea-surf edge#Mingling with bright small shells...#Bush-clover petals
Basho#The river gathering may rains#From cold streamlets for the sea...#Murmuring Mogami
